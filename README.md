# Image Signature Manager

Image Signer is a modern Python based desktop application for digitally signing images with embedded metadata. It uses a combination of SHA 512 hashing, SQLite storage, JSON based signature formats, and invisible pixel level data embedding for secure image traceability.

> Built with `Tkinter`, `Pillow`, `sqlite3`, and a strong focus on usability and digital integrity.

## Features

* **Digital Image Signing** with embedded invisible metadata
* **Receivers & Comments** for image tracking
* **Powerful Search Tools**

  * By ID
  * By SHA-512 hash
  * By hidden metadata in pixels
* **SQLite Integration** for persistent image data
* **Modern Tkinter GUI** with tabbed navigation and live image preview
* **Image & Signature Archiving** with structured folder output
* **Metadata Extraction** & integrity validation

## How It Works

### Signature Creation

1. You select an image and input receiver information.
2. The app generates:

   * a unique image ID
   * a digital signature (`.json`) with SHA-512 hash
   * an embedded copy of the image with the ID hidden in its pixels.
3. All data is stored in an SQLite database.

### Hidden Metadata

The hidden metadata is embedded directly into the pixel data using steganography principles (using LSB bit manipulation). This allows the signature to be validated laterâ€”even if the image appears visually unchanged.

## GUI Overview

| Tab                 | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sign Image**      | Select image, enter receiver + comment, sign, and save with preview     |
| **Manage Images**   | View all signed images, refresh list, open files, and show full details |
| **Search**          | Search by ID or by image hash                                           |
| **Metadata Search** | Load image and check for embedded ID and match in database              |

## Requirements

> All dependencies are standard or easily installable via pip.

* Python 3.8+
* `Pillow`
* `tkinter` (preinstalled with most Python distributions)
* `sqlite3` (builtin)
* Other standard modules: `hashlib`, `json`, `secrets`, `base64`, etc.

Install dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Installation

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xbymilow/image-signer.git
cd image-signer
python -m venv .venv
WINDOWS: .venv\Scripts\activate LINUX: source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

## Example Use Case

1. Select an image (e.g., `sample.png`)
2. Enter:

   * Receiver: `John Doe`
   * Comment: `Confidential Project Image`
3. Click **Sign Image**
4. Output:

   * A new image in `data/images/` with embedded metadata
   * A `.json` signature file in `data/signatures/`
   * Entry in `database.db`

You can now validate this image at any time via the **Metadata Search** tab.

## Security

* SHA-512 ensures high-fidelity hash validation.
* Embedded metadata is invisible to casual inspection and standard EXIF tools.
* Optional: Extend with signature verification or encryption for production use.
